Hothouse is a walled garden of mechanical flowers that respond to users as they enter the space. Like hothouses, walled gardens let some things bloom where they could never grow without the help.

Hothouse is an interactive installation of mechanical flowers, produced for Come Up To My Room at the Gladstone Hotel as part of Toronto Design Offsite Festival 2017. The flowers are controlled by gesture and proximity, made entirely of laser-cut plywood and cardboard.
