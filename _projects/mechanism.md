A custom server to run software for installations in small or limited spaces, Mechanism is a suite of software that can be perfectly reproduced on the generic Raspberry Pi system with an ISO burn. Used to power Screenperfect on Raspbian Linux, the Mechanism serves a captive portal control to a game controller that runs all projectors or screens in a single space.
