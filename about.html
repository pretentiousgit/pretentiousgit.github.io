    I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</a>, and I work on art and technology puzzles.

    I do a <em>lot</em> of client work with javascript, and I can be hired to do that. You can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:alex.leitch@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aeleitch">Twitter</a>.

    I'm curious about how systems work and interact, and have primarily worked on these ideas in the format of video games and giant dangerous art projects. As you can see from the blog, I basically care a lot about infrastructure, and I think about how to use our magic communication tools when off the internet. Through this, I care about letting people know how to use programming and computer languages more easily.
