<h3>Slide Content</h3>
This talk is, hopefully, about how something breaking makes it more legible, and therefore more human.

{{ Opener}}

{{Mandatory Cat Slide}}

{{Saint's Row}}
Saint’s Row 4, meticulously trippy break of experience using messed-up character models. This is a shot I chose because Saint's Row is the first triple-A game I've found to make specific use of glitch to call attention to how the player is shooting simulacra. These models are characters that have been messed up in a modeller, then, when interesting enough, selected to be a target in the shooting gallery.

This is interesting, because it calls attention to the uncanny-valley-ness of Saint's Row generally. Saint's Row is one of the most feminist shooting games I've run into, mainly by taking the Ripley route: you can gender-swap your lead character and do what you like with other characters. The plot of the fourth version, though, is that you are distinctly inside a machine, interacting with that machine. This is my favourite shooting game because of the possibilities for glitch, and the tongue-in-cheek self reference.

Software, famously, breaks. This is true of any project, but it is especially noticeable in game worlds, which pretend to be “complete.” Games seem more prone to bugs and glitches because of how players interact with them: a determined player, committed to exploring, will help things fall out of order. This can be pursued so far as to become an aesthetic of its own, and seen as combative, or it can be supported by game-makers, adding a depth of curiosity that is not possible in an uncollaborative practice.


{{ Glitched picture of Alex }}
This is an image glitched with intent. It represents a choice on my part to undermine the idea that a digital photo is a reliable representation of pretty much anything. A photo isn’t the thing itself, but the destruction of the image as image makes it more interesting to look at, more interesting to explore, to piece together. Some filters do this with meticulous colouration, and others do it by breaking things. A “pure” photo is no longer where the conversation lies.

Glitch can be characterized in any medium as the medium pursued to the point at which it breaks
As most people have probably heard, the crack is how the light gets in.


{{ Glitched Black Midi }}
Black Midi, from http://c-h-i-ll.com/guide-to-black-midi/

The classic example of a glitch aesthetic predates gaming by a wide margin: it is electric guitar distortion becoming the identifiable sound of rock music, or a drum machine going so quickly a human cannot reproduce it unassisted.

{{Breaking Madden}}

WHAT IS BREAKING MADDEN?
Glitch can be found in sports in drug testing, a desperate effort to hold back human breakage - or in Breaking Madden, an annual series where Cam Newton stacks an electronic squad so badly they start to fail in interesting ways. There are different tones in glitch aesthetic, but the point of the glitch is to look at and consider the medium itself, the ways in which agency causes and supports the break.

Madden is more interesting when glitched out - it breaks the simulation, destroys the idea that a game can and should be a narrative effort on par with cinema, or even compared to cinema, which does not rely on the agency of the audience to move the plot forward. 

{{The Doll Eyes easter egg from Bloodborne}}

Game developers face interesting media development problems: build a linear narrative game and you risk being compared to the movies, build something too complex and you risk players never seeing the majority of the work. Every additional piece of complexity makes it more likely that the game’s ‘mechanical’ components will break - Bloodborne’s mechanics are a combination of JRPG grind and fighting game, but it makes use of LINK TO ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING ARTICLE environmental storytelling to get its point across.

This talk can get bigger, but I think this is a good place to stop. Glitch, which destroys a player’s flow state, a player’s experience of the game as a complete interface, is an excellent way to encourage people to think more deeply and engage in a more human way with the system available. This ability to break free of the flow, to solve a puzzle rather than engage solely with a rote mechanic to “score points,” is what differentiates video games as art from slot machines.

Addiction is characterized as “un-making of self” in Natasha Schüll’s “Addiction By Design.” Glitch offers a straightforward way to snap out of the flow state of a game and think about what the author is trying to say with the mechanics and the game itself. It is not merely an aesthetic, but a mechanic in and of itself, one that offers reflection on how things are made, and how to be seen as human in a slick glass world.

{{Image from “The Other Paris” by Luc Sante}}
GLITCH AS NEOLIBERAL RESISTANCE ART FORM

In his book “The Other Paris,” Luc Sante includes a chapter entirely about flaneurship and exploration, called The Game. The Game is exploration of the city, a walking-about game that may have only ever made sense in old, un-razed cities. Cities built up on top of themselves are places with enough space to explore, and this is in contrast with cities built to impress. Sante goes out of his way to point out how every civic works project destroys a place with people in it already, by making that space more legible to authority/an overseer. Game levels are often also built to emphasize grandeur, and in doing so eliminate a sense of safety and privacy.

{{ London }}
This is the City of London, a corporation used almost entirely to shove capital around the world without being traced. It is also a large number of glass boxes, which become uninhabitable in about an hour if they are not hooked to a central grid, fact care of When the Lights Went Out: A History of Blackouts in America by David E. Nye. These companies have generators… but the generators are there to make sure people can get out, they aren’t preservationist.
The skyscrapers of London are grandiose, but prone to glitching out in case of anything going wrong. Their coherent skins are as much a lie as the skins of the games we put together.


{{scrunch slide}}
In here, we see that an app that makes use of glitch is percieved as malware by well-intentioned anti-malware software. This is a game where you draw sound rainbows, it's basically an art piece - the goal is to play with sound and light.


{{ Undertale Glitch Example -- glitch as a mechanic }}

{{ Now we talk about neoliberalism and Nintendo as a form of capitalist skin }}
Item Abuse, by PangaeaPanga - now taken down by Nintendo because Mario Maker exists, which they are also removing levels from.

Video games do not generally build on top of themselves, with the notable exception of speedruns and custom hacks put together, like Mario Must Die, a hack of Super Mario World. The hacks of games get taken down by corporations - without being legible, that is, produced via an authorised tool, the levels are of no perceptible benefit to the authority and therefore are seen as devoid of value.

{{Hypercube example}}
How to solve Hypercube, a level taking advantage of a glitch in Mario Maker. The author of this article, Patrick Klepek, makes the point that you essentially need to open the editor - break the fourth wall - to solve the level. You can’t have one without the other.

Nintendo has since removed the level, because making use of glitch is, to their mind, breaking the product. This reinforces the unfortunate view of games as a consumable, rather than a level editor as cooperative practice.

{{ Thank you, mention of Panama Papers }}
The slick glass world is beautiful, but it offers no room for the grit that breaks down the machine. We are facing a world where a failure to update wordpress can bring down a prime minister (panama papers), so it is appropriate that glitch is coming to our most contemporary art form. Thank you for your time.
