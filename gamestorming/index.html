          This is a brainstorming exercise designed to produce about four game ideas per person. It is best at generating game premises.
        </p>  
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        
        <p>
          Click the cards above to flip them, then describe a game idea that would match all the turned cards together.
        </p>
        
        <div>
          In a group of 3-6 players, with each player taking a 1.5-minute turn:
          <ul>
            <li>The player whose turn it is turns over the cards</li>
            <li>Everyone in the group takes 1.5 minutes and writes up an app idea that matches the prompts</li>
            <li>After time, the group presents and discusses their ideas, and pass them to the main player</li>
            <li>Play concludes when every player has had a turn and collected ideas from their group</li>
            <li>The group should now have a diverse array of possible game designs to draw from</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>
          What each card does
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pick a <b>setting</b>, ranging from the familiar to the remote
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Select a <b>feature</b> that may not be immediately clear, but would be an important part of the game <strong>premise</strong>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Choose a <b>mechanic</b> or way the game could be played
          </li>

          <li>
            Quickly write down your game idea, keeping it as fast as possible
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Describe your speculative future app and how it aims to responsibly
            manage information to benefit its users
          </li>
        </ol>
  
        <p>
          Get creative and see what ideas you can come up with! The goal is to
          think about potential futures and how apps and information technology
          might evolve to play constructive roles.
