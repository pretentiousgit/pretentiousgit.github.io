Somewhere, someone is boarding a train on a late summer evening.
There are clouds on the horizon.
The train will soon be cancelled.
Like many people, you just don't know who to be. Will the train take you to your destination, or leave you awake in your childhood suburb?

Paris Night Train is a procedurally-generated adventure taking place on a train at night. Written in Phaser.io and Redux with an emphasis on contemporary packaging technologies, the game is designed to supply an open-source framework and boilerplate for 2D games that can be easily exported to mobile and desktop internet platforms.

Development of Paris Night Train was started through a residency with Torontoâ€™s Hand Eye Society at Toronto Public Library Oakwood.
