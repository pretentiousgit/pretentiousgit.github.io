The Nebula Space Derby is an interactive game driven using OSC controls to a Node.js server that drives an HD projection of whales sailing through space. The Derby lives in an appliance-level server and is controlled using a game masterâ€™s separate admin screen. Written in Node 8/React/Redux using the Tumult Hype animation framework
