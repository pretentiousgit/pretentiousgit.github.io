Paris Night Train is a procedurally-generated adventure taking place on a train at night. Written in Phaser.io and Redux with an emphasis on contemporary packaging technologies, the game is designed to supply an open-source framework and boilerplate for 2D games that can be easily exported to mobile and desktop internet platforms. Sponsored by Torontoâ€™s Hand Eye Society and the Ontario/Toronto Arts Councils.
