# pretentiousgit.github.io

This site is based on the **[Leonids](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids)** theme.

It is the personal/project site of Alex Leitch, who doesn't really have time to update or maintain it.
Such is life.

The site is built using Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator that plays nicely with GitHub.
