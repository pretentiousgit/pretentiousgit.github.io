PsXXYborg is a dual-screen installation in a van, acting as a shrine to the elevation of your soul as enacted through a dodgy cult - which is lying. PsXXYborgâ€™s players instead are encouraged to upload their soul away from their flesh. The game investigates the promise of the singularity as held against the reality of the human body. 

PsXXYborg is the work of Hannah Epstein, Sagan Yee, and Alex Leitch. This represented the first exhibition of the ScreenPerfect software suite, sans development interface.
