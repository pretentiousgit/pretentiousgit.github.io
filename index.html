            </p>
            <p>
              As a PhD candidate at UMD and lecturer in Human-Computer
              Interaction, I research the relationship between hands-on making
              and technological understanding.
              <a href="#teaching">My classes</a> cover interaction design with
              an STS focus, game design with a focus on procedural generation,
              and the programming of human-centered interfaces. My writing often
              ends up being about (mis)trust and safety, how the mutability of
              interfaces impacts what can be believed about the world. I am
              always trying to figure out how the magic trick works.

            <p>
              This is a list of classes I have designed for UMD. I have
              previously taught independent workshops at ITP-NYU, OCADu, and for
              a variety of private clients.
            </p>
            <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
            <p>
              A graduate-level design course that takes students through how to
              think about what an "app" actually is, using introductory STS
              texts as conversation and design prompts. Students work in small
              groups to design a speculative future where we can see one
              person's phone screen and all the applications they use in the
              course of a day. I have been teaching this class for various
              institutions since <strong>2015</strong>.
            </p>
            <h4>Programming Human-Centered Interfaces</h4>
            <p>
              A mixed-level creative-code approach to interface programming.
              Students learn about javascript frameworks, data storage, data
              privacy, and the history of the surveillance internet while
              building an HTML5/CSS/JS interface they design in Figma. Students
              learn the business history of the web along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course runs every semester. The software I use to teach has
              shut down or substantially changed every six months since the
              course started in
              <strong>2019</strong>.
            </p>
            <h4>Game Design</h4>
            <p>
              A mixed-level course based on Tracey Fullerton's Game Design
              Workshop, students will go through a non-digital game design two
              weeks for the whole semester. They learn about the trade-offs
              between paper prototyping, software development, user testing, and
              the shortcuts used to get to launch. Readings look at
              behaviourism, gambling, visualisation of dynamic data, deceptive
              patterns, mass online games, and focus on how game environments
              push HCI research. The next version of this is
              <strong>Spring 2026.</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Technology and Spectacle</h4>
            <p>
              Drone shows, LED panels, live code, flamethrowers and concert
              support: how do public art installations work? This mixed-level
              course takes students through how to use contemporary live-code
              and public installation software to build showcase installations.
              This course will run in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Makerspaces</h4>
            <p>
              What is piracy, anyway? Why is it different than DIY, or
              manufacturing? This graduate-level course looks at what dupes and
              counterfeits are while teaching students to use digital
              fabrication tools to produce physical objects. This course has not
              run recently.

              This book chapter is about how when you can't consistently see
              someone else's lunch on the timeline, the timeline makes you more
              lonely and more prone to believing things that might not
              necessarily be the most truthful.

              overcommitment from target user populations, which makes it really

              This essay on how difficult it is to catch a break in Canadian
              retail did something like 225,000 views in an hour when it went
              live just after the closure of Target in Canada. Canada's now seen
              the Hudson Bay itself close; retail is very difficult in Canada.
              It is much <em>more</em> difficult when hedge fund debts get
              involved, but the distances, population gap, and centralization of
              the fashion industry in Quebec - and China - hasn't changed much
              in ten years.

                Viridian Design versus the Culture Industry. 2013.</a
              >
              This polemic adequately expresses my dislike, even at the time,
              for how people close to the tech industry handle the culture
              industry.

              Alex Leitch is a lecturer and PhD student at the University of
              Maryland, College Park. They teach courses on how computers
              interact with people and vice-versa. Alex's current research is on
              how people's use of tools impacts their understanding and
              acceptance of differing visions of the technical future.
